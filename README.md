## TrackWallet - Expense Tracker

The expense tracker application helps in managing personal finances
by tracking and categorizing the expenses.It provides insights into the financial health of the user
.The application allows users to track their expenses,
set budgets and view spending based on the time and category.This application gives clear understanding of 
one's spending patterns,identifying areas to save money and ultimately work towards understanding financial goals.

The application is designed for individuals looking  to gain better control 
over their personal finances especially like frequent shoppers.

I recognize that responsible money management and prioritizing expenses  is important 
and believe that this application would align with that  by helping individuals 
make informed financial decisions and contribute to stability.
